\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Represents a trigger on the controller. 

This struct is used to represent a trigger on the controller. It contains a value to represent the position of the trigger. Since we want to output trigger positions as ASCII, we store the trigger value as a percentage of the maximum value. For example, a trigger pressed all the way down would be 100\%. Each trigger also has a unique string identifier of length 2 to represent the trigger in ASCII. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
main/\mbox{\hyperlink{con__state_8h}{con\+\_\+state.\+h}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
