The ble utility functions are organized into modules\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item auth\+\_\+gap\+: Sets up low-\/level GAP profile for connecting to the Google Stadia controller using proper security and authentication
\item gattc.\+c\+: Sets up a GATT client profile which establishes notification on and reads HID reports from the Stadia controller
\item bt\+\_\+init\+: Methods used to fully intialize the bluetooth hardware, bluetooth stack, GATT and GAP profiles, and ble authentication
