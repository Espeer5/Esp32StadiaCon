\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Represents a joystick on the controller. 

This struct is used to represent a joystick on the controller. It contains two values, x and y, to represent the position of the joystick. Since we want to output joystick positions as ASCII, we store the x and y values as perentages of maximum values. For example, a stick all the way left would be -\/100\% along the x-\/axis, and a stick all the way up would be 100\% along the y-\/axis. Each stick also has a unique string identifier of length 2 to represent the stick in ASCII. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
